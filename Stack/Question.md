## Problem Statement

**Design, develop, and implement a program in C to handle the following operations on a stack of integers:**

1. **Push**: Add an element to the stack.  
2. **Pop**: Remove an element from the stack.  
3. **Check Palindrome**: Demonstrate how the stack can be used to check if a word is a palindrome.  
4. **Overflow and Underflow**: Demonstrate situations where the stack overflows or underflows due to size constraints.  
5. **Display**: Show the current status of the stack.  
6. **Exit**: Terminate the program.
